# Deep-Statistical-Arbitrage
This repository stores the implementation of the paper "DETECTING DATA-DRIVEN ROBUST STATISTICAL ARBITRAGE STRATEGIES WITH DEEP NEURAL NETWORKS". 
This project is originally the final year project of Yin Daiying from Mathematical Sciences @ NTU, Singapore, under the supervision of Nanyang Asst Prof. Ariel Neufeld and Dr. Julian Sester. 

Our implementation is based on the deep learning engine Pytorch.
To execute the code, one simply place the datasets(start and end dates aligned) in the same directory as the .py file and adjust the training/testing date. (CUDA is required)
There is only one implementation for high dimensional assets, which is applied to the cases of 10-50 assets in the paper. To understand the code better, please refer to the 30_assets code, where you can find more detailed comments.

 Enjoy! :)
